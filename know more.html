                    HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the fundamental building block of the World Wide Web.
                     It is a markup language that web developers use to create the structure and content of web pages.
                      HTML allows you to define the various elements that make up a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, 
                      links, images, and forms, by using a system of tags and attributes.

                    heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element
                    that you define.

                   In this module, The HTML and element is the generic container for flow content and does not
                   inherently represent anything. Use it to group elements for purposes such as styling (using the class or id
                   attributes), and inline level and block level separation.

                <dd>
                    In this module, The HTML  element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent
                    element: an ordered list an unordered list, or a menu. In menus and unordered lists,
                    list items are usually displayed using bullet points, now we are going to check how to use html list

                    In this module, the Web was just text, and it was really quite boring. Fortunately, it was not too long before
                    the ability to embed images (and other more interesting types of content) inside web pages was added. There
                    are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble element, used to
                    embed a simple image in a webpage. This module will help you to make use of image mapping

                    In this module, representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a
                    challenge. This module covers basic table markup, along with more complex features such as implementing
                    captions and summaries.

                    In this module, Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you
                    need for interacting with web sites, e.g. registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and
                    more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side parts of forms.
